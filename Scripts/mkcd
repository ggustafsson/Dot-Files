# Description: This script creates a directory (or several directories) and
# then changes the current working directory to the one just created.

# This script is best used from an alias. I have this in ~/.zshrc:
#
# alias mkcd=". mkcd"
#
# The dot before the script name must be there otherwise the current directory
# will not change in the current shell.

# Usage: mkcd <path>
#        mkcd <directory1/directory2/...>

if [[ ! $# -eq 1 ]]; then
  echo "Usage: $0:t [PATH]..."
  exit
fi

mkdir -p $1
cd $1
